# 3F3: Statistical Signal Processing

## Content

This repo contains my code for the Cambridge University Engineering Department part IIA module 3F3: statistical signal processing. The lab aims to introduce the idea of random variables and function of random variables; to study the Jacobian as used with random variables; and to experiment with method for non-uniform random number generation.  

The functions contained in the python file provide insight into these topics, and the figures that they generate are analysed in the pdf report.
